Winner of Brickhack 6 Hackathon under theme "Social Good" for best use of Wegman's API.

We have identified two major issues with the way people donate to charity. The first is a lack of control in regards to where your donation is used and the second is a scarcity of personal connection between both parties involved. We sought to address these issues in our web app MealShare. Some of our major accomplishments include building a very functional demo with live real-time updates between the donor and requester interfaces! What's next for us is implementing a real payment system and connection with postal service to deliver donations and purchases.
